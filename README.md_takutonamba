Title of project
Music creation from midi files using machine learning

Abstract
This project aims to seek the potential of generating the music based on sounds, and to create the harmony that is similar to the input sounds with the machine learning. I will use different sounds, such as drums and pianos, and see how the machine learning will train itself to learn from them. I also hope to create the different harmony depending on the input sounds.
